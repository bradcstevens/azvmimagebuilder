To use this, see this [blog](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/announcing-private-preview-of-azure-vm-image-builder/) and sign up!

This repo contains test templates for Azure VM Image Builder.

There are two types for you to uses.
* Azure Resource Manager (ARM) deployment templates and parameters files - this will allow you to create an ImageTemplate immediately using ARM. The beauty of these examples, they are heavily parameterized, so you just need to drop in your own details, then begin image building! 
* Raw Image Builder Templates - these are examples of Azure VM Image Builder Template, you can use these when submitting an Image Template directly to the Azure Resource Provider, and they are also good for understanding basic templates.
